COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization in Relation to World Happiness Report

Purpose:
In this project, we aim to analyze and visualize COVID-19 deaths data by
country and date, correlate it with the World Happiness Report, and explore
potential connections between health outcomes and happiness factors.

Data Collection:
- Collected COVID-19 deaths data, including the number of deaths by country
and date.
- Gathered the World Happiness Report dataset, containing factors influencing
happiness and well-being across countries, such as social support, healthy life
expectancy, freedom to life choices, GDP per capita, etc.

Data Visualization:
1. COVID-19 Deaths Over Time by Country:
Visualized the progression of COVID-19 deaths using line charts. Each line
represents a country, showcasing the death toll over different dates. This
visualization helps us understand the impact of the pandemic across countries
and over time.
2. Maximum Infection Rate by Country:
Represented the highest daily infection rate for each country using a line chart.
3. Correlation Matrix:
Created a heatmap illustrating the correlation between COVID-19 deaths and
factors from the World Happiness Report. By plotting this matrix, we want to
uncover any relationships between happiness indicators and health outcomes.
a. GDP vs. Maximum Infection Rate: Plotted a scatter plot with a country's
GDP per capita on the x-axis and the maximum infection rate on the
y-axis.
b. Social Support vs.Maximum Infection Rate: Plotted a scatter plot with a
country's Social Support on the x-axis and the maximum infection rate on
the y-axis.
c. Healthy life expectancy vs. Maximum Infection Rate: Plotted a scatter plot
with a country's Healthy life expectancy on the x-axis and the maximum
infection rate on the y-axis.
These graphs helps us explore whether a country's economic strength and
happiness factors relates to its COVID-19 infection rates.
Analysis and Insights:
1. We observed that some countries experienced a higher number of deaths
due to COVID-19, indicating varying levels of impact globally.
2. The maximum infection rate visualization highlighted regions where the
pandemic hit hardest, offering insights into the spread and containment of the
virus.
3. The correlation matrix provided connections between happiness factors and
COVID-19 deaths. Certain factors, such as healthy life expectancy and social
support, demonstrated potential links with pandemic outcomes.
4. Exploring GDP vs. maximum infection rate showed that economic strength
might play a role in managing the virus,.
5. Exploring Health life expectancy vs maximum infection rate: Including this
factor in our analysis offers a deeper understanding of a country's overall health
infrastructure, which in turn can impact its resilience in facing a pandemic.
Conclusion:
This project delved into the intersection of COVID-19 deaths, the World
Happiness Report, and global socio-economic dynamics. Through
comprehensive data analysis and visualizations, we uncovered valuable
insights into how various factors impact pandemic outcomes and world
happiness levels. Our findings will contribute to have a better understanding of
the challenges faced by different countries. Such analyses can aid
policymakers and researchers in making informed decisions.
Future Considerations:
- Exploring additional datasets to gain a more comprehensive understanding of
the pandemic's impact.
- Incorporating machine learning models to predict potential future trends based
on historical data.
- Conducting sentiment analysis on social media data to gauge public reactions
during the pandemic
